"""
Interpreter - a component that processes structured text data.
It does so by:
- turning text data into separate lexical tokens (lexing) and
- then interpreting sequences of said tokens (parsing)

Motivation:
- textual input needs to be processed (e.g. turned into OOP structures)
- turning strings into OOP base structures is a complicated process

Examples:
- programming language compilers, interpreters, static analysis tools, IDEs, etc.
- HTML, XML and similar
- regular expressions
