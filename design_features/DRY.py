"""
DRY - do not repeat yourself.

Each part of the system should be presented in code only once (i.e. do not write the same/similar code more than once) -
avoid duplicates and inconsistencies! (otherwise, whenever you need to change something about your code, you'll need to make
that change in multiple places throughout your application) + single source of truth (SSOT).

DRY is used for decomposing tasks into smallest possible reusable elements which can later be used to solve different
problems - reusability matters! - module architecture.

Violation of DRY - WET - "Write Everything Twice" or "We Enjoy Typing".
