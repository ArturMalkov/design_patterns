YAGNI - You Ain't Gonna Need It.

Features not specified in the system requirements (specifications) shouldn't be implemented.
- client shouldn't pay for the functionality it didn't ask for;
- engineers shouldn't make decisions for their client;
- there are no free features/functions in products (everything requires time, resources (tests, CI/CD, configs,
documentation), etc.).

Why YAGNI?
- unnecessary functionality takes time from implementing necessary functionality;
- unnecessary functionality can make it difficult to add new necessary functionality;
- it's difficult to test unnecessary functionality - QA engineers only work with features specified in system requirements.
- undocumented features will likely remain unused by users;
- in fixed-price projects, client can ask to add more free functionality.
